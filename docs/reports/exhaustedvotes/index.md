title: Exhausted votes
---

These tables show the number of exhausted votes. A ballot's exhaustion is calculated with the 
[`ExhaustionCalculator` class](https://github.com/tmccarthy/SenateDB/blob/v0.4.1/src/main/scala/au/id/tmm/senatedb/computations/exhaustion/ExhaustionCalculator.scala).
This is done by tracing the path a ballot would have taken through the count proces as described in data made 
available [on the AEC website](http://results.aec.gov.au/20499/Website/SenateDownloadsMenu-20499-Csv.htm#mainbody_titleDop).

## Explanation

Votes for the Senate are counted according to the [single transferable vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote)
system. Under this system, ballots are allocated to their first preference, and candidates are then either elected or 
excluded until all positions have been filled. At each count, the ballots of a candidate that has been elected or 
excluded are distributed to their next preference. This process is described in more detail on 
[the AEC website](http://www.aec.gov.au/voting/counting/senate_count.htm).

During the count, a situation can arise where a ballot must be distributed to its next preference, but it either does
not express further preferences or all its remaining preferences have either been elected or excluded. Such a ballot is
said to *exhaust*. Because it expresses no further preference, it is set aside and takes no further part in the count.

Prior to the 2016 Federal Election, exhausted ballots were exceedingly rare in Australian Senate elections. Votes above
the line were preferenced according to a [group voting ticket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_voting_ticket). These
expressed preferences for all candidates, and so could never exhaust. Votes below the line were required to enumerate 
preferences for every candidate, and so these would also never exhaust. A ballot could only exhaust if it was numbered 
below the line, and contained a counting error. In this case, savings provisions in the Electoral Act would mean the 
vote was still formal, but its preferences would stop flowing at the counting error.

At the 2016 Federal Election, group voting tickets were abolished, and voters were required to express their own 
preferences. They were told to number at least 6 squares above the line, or at least 12 below the line (actual formality
requirements were less strict, see [the report on saved ballots](../savedballots)). Since the vast majority of ballots
did not express a preference for every candidate, exhaustion became much more common.

#### Exhausted ballots vs exhausted votes

Under the single transferable vote system, a ballot that preferences a candidate that is elected continues to 
participate in the count (according to its preferences) at a reduced, "transfer" value. The transfer value is explained
in more detail by the AEC [here](http://www.aec.gov.au/voting/counting/senate_count.htm#surplus).

The transfer value is important when considering exhaustion. When a candidate is elected with only a handful of surplus 
votes, the ballots distributed from that candidate are passed on with a very small transfer value. If these ballots go 
on to exhaust, their total value (and hence their potential impact) is small. On the other hand, when a candidate is 
excluded, their ballots continue at full value. If these exhaust, their total value is large, and their greater 
potential impact is lost.

SenateDB describes this difference by differentiating between the terms "exhausted ballots" and "exhausted votes":

* A tally of **exhausted ballots** describes the total number of ballot papers that had exhausted by the final count, 
  without reference to their transfer value when they exhausted.
* A tally of **exhausted votes** describes the total transfer value of ballot papers that were exhausted at the final 
  count.

Because a tally of **exhausted votes** counts exhausted ballot papers according to their transfer value, it can 
reasonably be used to make inferences about the impact of exhausted votes. A tally of **exhausted ballots** is not 
appropriate for this purpose.

The tables on this page are of **exhausted votes**. You can view those for *exhausted ballots* [here](../exhaustedballots)

#### Comparison to AEC data

It is worth pointing out that there are small differences in the total number of exhausted votes listed here, and those
recorded in the distribution of preferences data recorded by the AEC. This is because the AEC rounds the total 
number of exhausted votes to the nearest integer at the end of every count. This rounding cannot be meaningfully 
replicated when calculating the exhaustion value *of a single ballot*, and so is not done for these aggregate counts.
