# How-to-vote cards in the 2016 Senate election

At the 2016 election, only 14.5% of voters used a how-to-vote card when voting in the Senate. Only Labor and Coalition 
voters followed how-to-vote cards more than 10% of the time.

## Overview

Prior to 2016, most voters would simply indicate their first preference. Preferences were then distributed according to
the group voting tickets defined by the parties. Changes to rules for voting in the Senate in 2016 abolished group 
voting tickets, requiring voters to specify their own preferences entirely. The AEC uploads the full preferences of 
every formal ballot to their website ([link](https://results.aec.gov.au/20499/Website/SenateDownloadsMenu-20499-Csv.htm#mainbody_titleStateBtl)).
With the preferences of every formal ballot available, for the first we can determine the exact rate at which 
how-to-vote cards are followed in a federal election.

Antony Green has written an article pulling together some previous surveys of how-to-vote card usage at state elections
([link](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-09-29/do-australians-follow-how-to-votes/9389834)). For House of Assembly 
elections in 2010, South Australia and Victoria had 42.1% and 38.7% compliance with how-to-vote cards, respectively. 
This is much higher than the rates presented here in the Senate. How-to-vote cards therefore may be more effective in 
lower house elections. Even so, the small rates of how-to-vote card usage in Senate elections, particularly for the 
minor parties, should prompt reconsideration of preference deals done with minor parties.

Coalition voters were by far the most likely to use a how-to-vote card at the 2016 election. Labor voters were less than
half as likely as Coalition voters to use them.

## Methodology

How-to-vote cards were based on those by the ABC ([link](https://www.abc.net.au/news/federal-election-2016/guide/svic/htv/)).

A ballot is counted as following a how-to-vote card if its preferences match those on the card 
exactly, and no preferences were expressed below the line. The how-to-vote card must have specified at least 6 
preferences and an exact order for them.

Some how-to-vote cards (eg from the Jacquie Lambie Network) simply told voters where to put their first preference and 
then asked them to fill in the rest as they saw fit. Others (eg the Motoring Enthusiasts) specified which parties to 
preference, but not the order. Because these were not unambiguous how-to-vote cards, they have been ignored in this 
analysis.

The Tasmanian One Nation how-to-vote card incorrectly listed the group id for the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party. 
This was fixed in this analysis.
