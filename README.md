# SenateDB

A tool for collating and analysing the raw data about Australian Senate elections made available on the 
Australian Electoral Commission's website. This is essentially a slightly more ambitious rewrite of my 
other project at [HypotheticalSenate](https://github.com/tmccarthy/HypotheticalSenate). The initial focus
will be analysing the 2016 election.

## Results

Results and reports from version 0.4 of the tool are available at [https://tmccarthy.github.io/SenateDB/](https://tmccarthy.github.io/SenateDB/).

## Overview

The AEC makes a huge amount of raw data about elections available on 
[their website](http://results.aec.gov.au/20499/Website/SenateDownloadsMenu-20499-Csv.htm). This includes the raw 
preferences expressed on every single formal ballot paper in the Senate election. The data is made available in CSV 
format, which does not lend itself to easy analysis.

SenateDB is intended to grow into a set of tools to analyse this data. Its original incarnation (version 0.1) loaded the
data into a relational database. You can view that tool [here](https://github.com/tmccarthy/SenateDB/tree/v0.1).

## Running

SenateDB is built and run with [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/). Simply check it out and run `sbt core/run` to generate 
the reports.

SenateDB will download the raw data from the AEC the first time it is run (about 180 MB), and then reads through these
files to generate the reports. The report generation takes about 17 minutes on my Macbook Pro.
